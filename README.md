# Foto Finder 

This is my final project for the first module at Turing School of Software and Design. This project has been incredibly fast paced, but I am pleased with the point that I am at now. I will be pairing with an instructor for a code review on Wednesday January 9th, 2019, which will determine if I am able to pass to the next module. 

# Goals 
- Building on the lessons learned in Idea Box
- Creating well structured, semantic HTML
- Creating clean, precise, and D.R.Y. ("Don't Repeat Yourself") CSS
- Creating D.R.Y. JavaScript

# Motivation

I want to pass this first module very much because I believe that I have proved myself throughout the module. I am eager and excited to move past "vanilla" JavaScript and on to more advanced topics. 

# Built with

- Sublime
- DevTools on Google Chrome Canary

# Languages Built in 

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# Screen Grab of Static Comp Provided



# Screen Grab of the Static Site Created



# Shortcomings

Time is always a factor at Turing. I would have liked to improve user experience by building out more functionality such as a "Show More" button and a functioning "View Favorites" button.
